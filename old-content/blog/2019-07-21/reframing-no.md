The past few weeks I’ve felt like I’ve been saying "no" to more things. Specifically, I’ve said "no" to caffeine. "No" to bagels and muffins. "No" (loosely) to alcohol.

Suddenly, I was living a very restricted life. I had multiple people reach out to suggest alternatives so that I wouldn’t need to restrict myself and keep saying no.

I know willpower is not sufficient for behavior change. The thing is, I didn’t really feel like I was relying on willpower. I was giving these things up because I was saying yes to other things. I was prioritizing my health and happiness over the short term benefits.

And that’s the key. The issue isn’t the behavior change - it was the perspective.

No is a powerful word, but it’s often not the whole story. By stepping back and looking at the larger picture, it’s often relatively easy to reshape a narrative in a positive light.
