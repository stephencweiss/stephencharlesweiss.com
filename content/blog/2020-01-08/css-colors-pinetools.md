Useful Tools For Colors

I've been working on putting together a new theme for my website. In the process, I decided that I wanted to avoid the edges of the color box (i.e. no pure white or black) while supporting a light mode and a dark mode. 

That meant I needed a way to come up with complementary colors as well as the inverse. 

While sites like coolors.co are great for coming up with a nice set of colors, they're less helpful when you have a specific color and you're looking for it's inverse. 

[Pinetools.com](https://pinetools.com/c-colors/), on the other hand, has a bunch of tools for exactly these types of purposes. The color tools include: 

* Lighten Color
* Darken Color
* Change Color Saturation
* GreyScale/Desatureate A Color
* Invert A Color
* Random Color Generator
* Blend Color
* Gradient Generator
* Shift Hue of A Color
* Triad Color Scheme
* Tetrad Color Scheme
* Complementary Color
* Split Complementary Colors
* Analogous Color Scheme
* Monochormatic Colors Generator
* Square Color Scheme
* Image Color Picker
* Get Colors From Image

I haven't tried them all, but the invert and complementary color tools worked like a charm!
