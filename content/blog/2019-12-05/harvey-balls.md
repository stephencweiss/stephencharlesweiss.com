If you're like me, you've likely never heard of a Harvey Ball - though you'd recognize them if you saw it.

That's because Harvey Balls are used in numerous industries and functions to quickly communicate information - whether it's the status of a project or the placement of a well on a map.

Their ability to convey information despite their simplicity is impressive.

Next time you need to discuss status of a project... describe the phase of a moon or the weather, you might want to reach for a Harvey Ball.
