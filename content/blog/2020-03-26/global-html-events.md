When it comes to coding, there's always something new to learn. One of the areas I find I have a hard time with are

Take, for example, this list of [GlobalEventHandlers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers) compiled by MDN.

> The **GlobalEventHandlers** mixin describes the event handlers common to several interfaces like [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement), [Document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document), or [Window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window). Each of these interfaces can, of course, add more event handlers in addition to the ones listed below.

Notice: these are the _common_ APIs between `HTMLElement`, `Document`, and `Window`. Yes, many are deprecated, experimental, not supported, or in some other way non-main stream. Yet, there are still dozens of interesting APIs here that I had no idea existed before.

Reading through this list is inspiring. I mean that quite literally in that I am inspired by the types of applications I can build that I had never really thought of before and so many new opportunities to hook into different parts of my application's life cycle.

Time to experiment!
